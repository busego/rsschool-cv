### 5. Code examples

The one of the latest Code examples on Algorithms subject in BSU 
(one function in Java):

```
public static void dijkstra2() {
        int j, way;
        m2[n] = 0;
        queue.add(new El(n, 0, false));

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int i = queue.pollFirst().num;
            if (H2[i] == 0) {
                H2[i] = 1;
                for (El edge : nodeList[i]) {
                    if (!edge.direction) {
                        j = edge.num;
                        way = edge.prior;
                        if (m2[i] + way < m2[j]) {
                            m2[j] = m2[i] + way;
                            queue.add(new El(j, m2[j], false));
                        }
                    }
